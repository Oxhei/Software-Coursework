Evalution of Software:                                                                                                                        |
I developed plenty operations in this program to validate user inputs such as name, UK postcode, credit card number, and expiration date.     |
I used regular expressions to make sure that the postcode format matched that of the United Kingdom. In the beginning,                        |
I ran into an error in which the program refused to accept an invalid card number.                                                            |
I fixed this problem by changing the isCardNumberValid() method to accept a reference to the card number string and adding a length check,    |
in summary I believe that the program is functional and meets the assignment's aims.                                                          |
However, I suggest some more improvements like as input validation for the number of things purchased and error handling.                     |
